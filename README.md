# Breast-Cancer-Classification
This algorithm is used to predict whether the person is suffering from Breast Cancer or not.
The primary objective of this Python project is to develop a classifier that utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze a breast cancer histology image dataset. The goal is to create a robust model capable of accurately classifying these images. The project focuses on leveraging the Keras library to design the CNN architecture, which will be referred to as "CancerNet." The CNN will be trained on the provided dataset of breast cancer histology images. The ultimate aim is to achieve high classification accuracy for these images using the CNN model.
